# Your CMake presets in this file should be designed to handle cross-compilation (using the provided
# Zig toolchain is recommended). When building the mod, CMake will be invoked 3 times to build
# extlib binaries for Windows, Macos, and Linux. The presets below are used to contruct
# `user_build_config.json` (if it isn't present already), which is read to determine what CMake
# presets to use. The presets are organized in to groups, with each group containing "Windows",
# "Macos", "Linux", and "Native" presets (more on the native preset below). The "Debug" preset group
# is the default, and the "Release" group is used by `create_thunderstore_package.py` when creating
# the Thunderstore release. You can also add more groups, using the make variable `EXTLIB_CMAKE_PRESET_GROUP`
# to choose the group when invoking make. You can change the presets in `user_build_config.json` in order use
# build with non-default presets locally (presets from `CMakeUserPresets.json`, for example) without modifying
# defaults here.

# "Native" presets are for building your mod using your local system tools/toolchain instead of cross-compilation.
# This can be a useful feature for debugging. The build scripts will automatically select default native
# presets suitable for your system when creating your `user_build_config.json` file, and you can easily
# add new presets to `CMakePresets.json` or `CMakeUserPresets.json` for further expansion. Use `make native`
# to run a native build. You can also select what presets you wish to use for your native build by assigning
# the make variables `NATIVE_CMAKE_CONFIGURE_PRESET` and `NATIVE_CMAKE_BUILD_PRESET`.
